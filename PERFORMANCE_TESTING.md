## Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Single User Performance
**Objective:** Verify canvas performance with increasing object count

**Steps:**
1. Open canvas in browser
2. Use AI agent to create 100 objects: "Create a 10x10 grid of circles"
3. Monitor FPS in console logs
4. Repeat with 200, 300, 500 objects
5. Test pan/zoom smoothness

**Expected Results:**
- 100 objects: 60 FPS
- 300 objects: 55-60 FPS
- 500 objects: 50-60 FPS
- Smooth pan/zoom at all object counts

### Scenario 2: Real-Time Collaboration (2 Users)
**Objective:** Measure sync latency between users

**Steps:**
1. Open canvas in two browser windows (use incognito for second user)
2. Sign in as different users in each window
3. Position windows side-by-side
4. User 1: Create/move objects
5. User 2: Observe sync time
6. Monitor console logs for sync performance

**Expected Results:**
- Object sync: <100ms (visible in logs)
- Cursor sync: <50ms (smooth cursor tracking)
- No conflicts or data loss

### Scenario 3: Multi-User Stress Test (5+ Users)
**Objective:** Test system under concurrent load

**Steps:**
1. Open canvas in 5+ browser tabs/windows
2. Sign in as different users (use incognito mode)
3. Have all users simultaneously:
   - Create objects
   - Move objects
   - Use AI agent
   - Change colors
4. Monitor performance logs in each window

**Expected Results:**
- Sync latency remains <100ms
- No dropped operations
- FPS remains >50 with active collaboration
- AI responses <5s per user

### Scenario 4: Network Resilience
**Objective:** Verify reconnection and operation queuing

**Steps:**
1. Open canvas and create some objects
2. Open browser DevTools â†’ Network tab
3. Set network to "Offline" mode
4. Create/modify objects (operations are queued)
5. Observe connection status banner
6. Set network back to "Online"
7. Verify queued operations sync

**Expected Results:**
- Connection status shows "Offline" with queue count
- Operations queue locally during disconnect
- Automatic reconnection within 1-5 seconds
- All queued operations sync successfully
- No data loss
- Refreshing the page while offline replays the persisted queue once the socket reconnects

### Scenario 5: AI Agent Performance
**Objective:** Test AI command execution speed

**Steps:**
1. Open canvas and AI chat
2. Execute simple command: "Create a red circle"
3. Execute complex command: "Create a 5x5 grid of alternating circles and squares"
4. Execute layout command: "Arrange all objects in a circle"
5. Monitor AI performance logs

**Expected Results:**
- Simple commands: 1-2s
- Complex commands: 2-4s
- Layout commands: 2-3s
- All commands complete successfully

## Performance Optimization Features

### 1. Debounced Database Writes
- Local state updates: Immediate (<10ms)
- Database persistence: Debounced 300ms
- Prevents excessive database calls
- Ensures data consistency

### 2. Efficient Canvas Rendering
- Uses HTML5 Canvas API
- Renders only visible objects
- Optimized transform calculations
- RequestAnimationFrame for smooth updates

### 3. Real-Time Broadcast Architecture
- Separate channels for objects, cursors, AI
- Broadcast-based sync (no polling)
- Supabase Realtime for low latency
- Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff

### 4. Operation Queuing
- Queues operations during disconnect
- Automatic replay on reconnection
- Prevents data loss
- Maintains operation order
- Persists queue between reloads so in-flight edits survive refreshes or crashes

## Architecture Performance Characteristics

### Database Layer (Supabase PostgreSQL)
- Row Level Security (RLS) for auth
- Indexed queries on canvas_id
- Connection pooling
- Expected latency: 50-150ms per query

### Real-Time Layer (Supabase Realtime)
- WebSocket-based communication
- Broadcast channels (no database round-trip)
- Expected latency: 20-80ms
- Handles 100+ concurrent connections per channel

### Frontend Layer (Next.js + React)
- Client-side rendering for canvas
- Optimistic updates for responsiveness
- Efficient state management with hooks
- Canvas rendering: 60 FPS target

### AI Layer (Vercel AI SDK + OpenAI)
- GPT-4o-mini for fast responses
- Streaming responses (not used for canvas)
- Expected latency: 1-4s depending on complexity
- Shared AI state via database queue

## Known Limitations

### 1. Object Count
- Tested up to 500 objects
- Performance degrades beyond 1000 objects
- Recommendation: Use frames/artboards for large projects

### 2. Concurrent Users
- Tested with 5 concurrent users
- Expected to handle 10-20 users
- Beyond 20 users may require optimization

### 3. Network Latency
- Performance depends on user's network
- High latency (>500ms) affects sync smoothness
- Reconnection handles temporary drops

### 4. Browser Performance
- Canvas rendering is CPU-intensive
- Older devices may experience lower FPS
- Recommendation: Modern browser on desktop
